## What are SOLID design principles?
1. Single Responsibility Principle: One class should have one and only one responsibility
2. Open Closed Principle: Software components should be open for extension, but closed for modification
3. Liskov's Substitution Principle: Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base type.
4. Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use
5. Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions

In simple terms, if you want to remember:
1. Reusability
2. Upgradability with Zero or minimal downtime
3. Scalability
4. Easy for Maintenance
5. Loose coupling
