## to point out

指摘する
I'd like to point out a few things about the new system.
新しいシステムについていくつか指摘したいのですが。

"**To point out**" is a **separable phrasal verb**.
This means we can separate the two words or keep them together when used with a noun (e.g. the policy).
However, when we use a pronoun (e.g. "it", "him", "her" etc.), this always goes between the two words.

Have a look at the examples below. 👀

| I'd like **to** **point out** the new policy. ✅ |
| --- |
| I'd like **to point** the new policy **out**. ✅ |
| I'd like **to point** it **out**. ✅ |
| I'd like to point out it. ❌ |
| We can also say:

I'd like **to point out** that this has been a good month for business.✅ |

## Let me just go over that again.

もう一度確認させてください。
This is quite a complicated process, so let me just go over that again.
これはかなり複雑なプロセスなので、もう一度確認させてください。
Unlike "**to point out**", "**to go over**" is a **non-separable phrasal verb**. This means the verb and preposition do not separate in a sentence.
Have a look at the examples below. 👀

| Let me **go over** this important point again.✅ |
| --- |
| Let me go this important point over again.❌ |
| Let me **go over** it again. ✅ |
| Let me go it over again. ❌ |
