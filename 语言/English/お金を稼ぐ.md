## wages

賃金
Although the cost of living is continuing to rise, most people's wages are not increasing accordingly.
生活費は上がり続けているのに、ほとんどの人の賃金はそれに応じて上がっていません。
**Salary or wages?**
"A** salary**" is a fixed amount of money, per month or year, whereas a worker's "**wages**" can vary depending on the number of hours worked.

In many countries, there is "**a minimum wage**", usually calculated per hour, which is the lowest amount an employer is allowed to pay by law.

| Gloria earns a good **salary** as an accountant. 👩‍💼 |
| --- |
| Ronnie often does extra shifts at the factory so that he can earn decent **wages**. 👨‍🏭 |
| Around the world, many people living in poverty do not even reach the **minimum wage**. |

## payday

給料日
I'm really looking forward to payday this month, I've nearly run out of money!
今月の給与支払日が本当に楽しみです。お金を使い果たしそうです！
Payday can be at the end of every month, every week or every two weeks depending on where you live.給与支払日は住んでいる場所によって毎月末、毎週末、隔週末となることがあります。 <a name="h1v4W"></a>

## overtime

時間外手当
I want to spend more time with my family, so I'm going to turn down any possible overtime that I'm offered.
家族ともっと時間を過ごしたいので、オファーされるかもしれない時間外労働を断る予定です。

"**Overtime**" can be different things:
1\. Extra work that you do in addition to your regular hours.💼
2\. The payment that you receive for this extra work. 💵

| 1. I usually try to **do** a lot of **overtime** in the month before I go on holiday. |
| --- |
| 2. It was worth doing all those extra hours last month to **earn** all that **overtime**. |

## a bonus

賞与（ボーナス）
My salary is pretty good but I'm lucky because I also receive a bonus for good performance.
私の給与はかなりいいのですが、業績が良くて賞与まで受け取れるのでラッキーです。
A company is legally required to pay overtime at a higher rate than usual, while a bonus is at the discretion of the company.会社は時間外手当を通常より高いレートで支払いをするよう法律で要求されていますが、一方で賞与は会社の判断に任されています。

## commission

歩合
"**Commission**" is an extra payment made to an employee, usually for selling something or getting a new client.
The conditions include 10% commission on everything you sell in addition to your regular salary.
通常の給与に加えて、あなたの売り上げ全体の10%の歩合が条件に含まれています。
We mostly use this word in two ways.

You can "**earn commission**" or "**get commission**" **on** work that you do. This is in addition to your salary.
You can also "**work on commission**", which means you are paid according to the amount that you sell.

| The sales staff at Kirbies **get **5% **commission on** everything they sell. |
| --- |
| Many salespeople **work on commission**. |

## a pension

年金
Due to the high cost of living, Gilbert had to find a part-time job because the state pension was not enough to live off.
生活費の高騰のため、ギルバートは公的年金が生計を立てるのに十分ではないのでアルバイトの仕事を見つける必要がありました。
If the population continues to grow older, the age we can claim a pension will increase.人工が高齢化し続ける場合、年金を請求できる年齢は上昇するでしょう。
