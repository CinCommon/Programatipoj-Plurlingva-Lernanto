## Tell me one of the most unforgetable project that you have.

## How do you collaborate with cross-function team?

PM team沟通时无法理解technical issue，专业上的认知不在一个level上，所以setup更多的session去解释这个问题。
知识层面的不对等。We didn't have the same concepts on the same prroject. I am a engineer so I just used my perspective to see the things. But for project manager, he needs to focus on the schedule, how to manage it, it's about the time. So we see the thing differently from different angle. gather all people from different departments, different countries, make sure we are in the same page.(Keep us in the same track)-- 频繁、定期的会议去对齐。 <a name="hQwba"></a>

## Have you failed to meet a deadline? In the end did you guys finish it or the project died?

Yes, I have experienced a situation where we failed to meet a deadline. It was a challenging time for our team as there was a lack of transparency from one team member who withheld crucial information. Unfortunately, this led to an incident that affected the project timeline. However, we took immediate action to address the situation and prevent it from happening again.
After the incident, we conducted a thorough retrospective analysis to understand the root causes and identify areas for improvement. We realized the importance of open and honest communication within the team. We emphasized the value of trust and collaboration, encouraging everyone to share concerns and mistakes openly without fear of judgment.
During the retrospective, we developed contingency plans for each potential risk or issue that could impact the project's timeline. We implemented a more robust system for sharing information and ensured that all team members were actively involved in decision-making processes.
Furthermore, we emphasized the concept of being a unified team, assuring everyone that making mistakes is a part of the learning process. We fostered an environment where individuals felt supported and encouraged to learn from their mistakes. This approach helped us rebuild trust within the team and strengthen our problem-solving capabilities.
Ultimately, these measures enabled us to overcome the challenges we faced and successfully complete the project. The experience taught us the importance of transparency, teamwork, and continuous improvement. It also instilled in us the belief that mistakes are opportunities for growth, as long as we approach them with a solution-oriented mindset. <a name="UjzIU"></a>

## What's your weaknesses

1. "I have always been a detail-oriented person, which has helped me ensure high quality in my work. However, at times, this focus on details has made me lose sight of the bigger picture. I am actively working on developing my ability to balance attention to detail with a broader strategic perspective. I have been seeking feedback from colleagues and reading books on leadership and strategic thinking to expand my mindset."
2. "In a previous role, I struggled with delegating tasks to team members because I felt the need to control every aspect of the project. However, I soon realized that this approach was not sustainable and limited the growth and development of my team members. To overcome this, I actively attended leadership workshops and sought guidance from mentors who helped me understand the importance of empowering others and trusting their capabilities." <a name="n4soj"></a>
