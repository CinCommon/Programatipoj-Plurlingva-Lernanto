Both "**to turn down**" and "**to take up**" are separable phrasal verbs.
This means we can separate the two words when we use them with a noun (e.g. an offer, an invitation), or we can keep them together. However, when we use a pronoun (e.g "it"), this goes between the two words.
Have a look at the examples below.👀

| I'm definitely going to **take up** the offer. ✅ | I'm definitely going to **take** the offer **up**. ✅ |
| --- | --- |
| I'm sorry but I have to **turn** your invitation **down**. ✅ | I'm sorry but I have to **turn down** your invitation. ✅ |
| I'd like to **take** it **up**. ✅ | I'd like to take up it. ❌ |
| I'm afraid I'm going to **turn** it **down**. ✅ | I'm afraid I'm going to turn down it. ❌ |
