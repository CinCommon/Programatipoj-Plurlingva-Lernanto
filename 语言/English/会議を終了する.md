この会議の目的に戻りましょう。

**to stick to**

**用例**

**to stray from**
～から脱線する
**用例**
We are beginning to stray from the main issue.
私たちは本題から脱線し始めています。
"**To stray from**" means to think or talk about a different subject from the one you should be giving attention to.

You can split the phrase "**stray from**" to show how far you have strayed.

Look at the examples, from straying a little (at the top), to straying a lot (at the bottom).

| We have **strayed **a bit **from **the original topic. |
| --- |
| We have **strayed **too far **from **the original topic. |
| We have **strayed **hugely **from **the original topic. |

Let's not stray too far from the problem we are trying to solve.
解決しようとしている問題から脱線しすぎないようにしましょう。
**the matter in hand**
目前のこと
**用例**
Let's stick to the matter in hand.
目前のことに集中しましょう。
"**The matter in hand**" is another way to refer to the topic that is being discussed in a meeting.
You might notice that people in the UK tend to say "*matter ****in**** hand*," but people in the US tend to say "*matter ****at**** hand*." Don't worry—the meaning is exactly the same.

And you can also replace the word "*matter*" with "*issue*" or "*topic*."

| (UK) Stick to the matter in hand. |
| --- |
| (UK) Stick to the issue in hand. |
| (US) Stick to the topic at hand. |
| (US) Stick to the matter at hand. |

Productive meetings allow colleagues to make decisions, reach consensus, share ideas, and solve problems … so, why do so many meetings feel like a waste of time?

The answer is often linked to the person running the meeting. The best facilitators know how to set goals and define the outcomes they want for each meeting. This focuses minds and keeps the discussion **relevant**, but it also gives a valid reason to interrupt and **get back to** the goal when discussions inevitably **get off topic**.

However, clear goals and defined outcomes need a strong agenda. But how can you make colleagues **stick to** your agenda? Imposing time limits can help. Most meetings don’t need to take one hour, in fact shorter stand-up meetings can stop colleagues **straying** **from **the topic. As discussions evolve, a good facilitator will frequently stop to ask if they are still dealing with **the matter in hand** or being distracted. Reminders like this focus minds and discussions too.

- Having goals and outcomes gives you a valid reason to interrupt and get back to the goal when discussions inevitably get off topic.目標と結果があると、議論が必然的に本題から外れたときに、中断して目標に戻る正当な理由が得られます。

Remember, **get back to** something means to return to it, while **get off topic** means to talk about something different.

| Can you **sum **the main points **up**? |
