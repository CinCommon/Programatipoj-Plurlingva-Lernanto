（1）数量
平时每天练习50-80句rs
考前三天突击每天200句
一定要保持数量才能逐渐找到感觉，瞬时记忆可以短时间锻炼出来！！一周后就能明显感到记的内容多了！
（2）每次练习都当考试
练习的时候用星🌟随身听即可，10个一组，就当作考试复述！平时紧张起来考试的时候才能游刃有余～
具体做法如下：
在纸上标题号，记录一下答题的流利度(见图3)
✨流利复述一半的就算过，打✓
✨没流利复述出来的，但是能听懂的单独标记打⭕️ 想一下原因是什么，比如没记住，可以试试只记前半部分后半部分或者只记主谓宾，然后复盘的时候重新听一遍顺一下
✨如果是一句话里几乎听不出来几个词的情况，需要单独标❌，学一下相关词汇，多念几遍，并特殊标记，隔两天拿出来听一下
考了好几次，并且rs流利度跟内容感觉都还行，分却上不去的姐妹，可以考虑一下是不是因为没有用正确读ra的方法读rs！！
