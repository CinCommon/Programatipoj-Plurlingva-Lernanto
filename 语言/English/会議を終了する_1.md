The best outcomes result from the most productive conversations. Such conversations require active participation and active listening skills. But those conversations can also be enhanced with timely and … active interruptions.

Although nobody likes to be **cut off** mid-flow, a well-timed interruption allows you **to add** important details or perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked. **Jumping in** like this also allows you to **make your point** while it is still relevant to the issue being discussed. Although it might feel impolite to **interject**, waiting for your turn to speak is simply not an option, especially when outcomes need to be reached quickly.

So, is it ever wrong to **interrupt**? Well, an angry customer might not thank you for cutting them off, but a timely interruption will allow you to take control and drive the conversation forward. Following these tips might just help.

1️⃣ Use body language to show you want to speak.
2️⃣ Wait for them to breathe or pause.
3️⃣ Use their name to take control.
4️⃣ Reference what they have said.
5️⃣ Keep your language polite and respectful.

ちょっと話を中断させてください。

**to jump in**

**to interject**
中断する

Although these verbs have a similar meaning, there is a very small difference.

We **interject** with small comments before letting the speaker continue.

**to cut someone off**

Knowing when, and how, to interrupt is never easy. After all, nobody likes to be interrupted.
So, take note of these phrases and notice how the words in *italics* can keep your interruption polite.

**to mean by**

**to lose someone**
脈絡・話を分からなくさせる
Sorry, but you've lost me now.
悪いけど、もう話が見えません。
If you **lose someone** when you are speaking to them, they have probably not understood what you said or what you meant.

So, try to stress the words in ***italics*** to stop your partner thinking that you were not listening.

And, definitely avoid stressing the pronouns that refer to your partner.
