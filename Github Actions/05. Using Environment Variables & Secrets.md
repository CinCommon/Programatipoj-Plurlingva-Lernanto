# Environment Variables & Secrets

## Environment Variables
- Dynamic values used in code(e.g. database name)
- May differ from workflow to wrokflow
- Can be defined on Workflow-, Job- or Step-level
- Can be used in code and in the Github Actions Workflow
- Accessible via interpolation and the env context object


## Secrets
- Some dynamic values should not be exposed anywhere
- Examples: Database credentials, API keys etc.
- Secrets can  be stored on Repository-level or via Environments
- Secrets can be referenced via the secrets context object

## GitHub Actions Environments
- Jobs can reference different GitHub Actions Environments
- Environments allow you to set up extra protection rules
- You can also store Secrets on Environment-level

## Use cases
GitHub Actions provides environments and secrets to help you manage and secure your workflow deployments. Here are five common use cases for GitHub Actions environments and secrets:

1. **Staging and Production Environments:**
    - Use GitHub Actions environments to define separate staging and production environments for your application.
    - Store environment-specific configuration details, such as database connection strings or API keys, as secrets.
    - Deploy your application to the staging environment for testing and then promote it to the production environment once it passes tests.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI) Testing:**
    - Set up GitHub Actions workflows to run automated tests on your codebase whenever changes are pushed.
    - Use secrets to store credentials or tokens required for your CI testing, such as access tokens for third-party services or databases.

3. **Deployments to Cloud Providers:**
    - Deploy applications to cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud using GitHub Actions.
    - Store cloud provider credentials and API keys as secrets to ensure secure deployments.

4. **Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs:**
    - Schedule periodic tasks or cron jobs using GitHub Actions workflows.
    - Secrets can be used to store tokens or authentication keys required for these scheduled tasks, such as refreshing API tokens or sending scheduled reports.

5. **Third-Party Integrations:**
    - Integrate with third-party services or APIs as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
    - Store API keys, OAuth tokens, or other sensitive information required for these integrations as secrets.
    - For example, you might use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of content to a content management system or trigger notifications on external platforms.

## Scenario
Based on the [previous blog](./04.%20Job%20Artifacts%20and%20Outputs.md), we mocked the operation which uploads our files onto S3 bucket, let's do it more but also in a mock way, I want to identify the target of the S3 bucket, something like: s3://cn-north-1/wabby-wabbo/, but I don't want to hard-code it in my github actions yaml file because it depends on different environment.
