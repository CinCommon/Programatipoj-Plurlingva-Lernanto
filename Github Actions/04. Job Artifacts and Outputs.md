Working with Artifacts
Working with Job Outputs
Caching Dependencies.

## Job Artifacts
Jobs Often product assets that should be shared or analyzed, these assets are referred to as "Artifacts"
Output Asserts are generated by a job, example: app binary, website files etc.
- Download & Use Manually via github UI or REST API
- Download & Use in other Jobs via Actions
- Typically used for sharing log files, app binaries etc.

```yaml
name: Deploy website
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

Use official action called `actions/upload-artifact@v3` and `actions/download-artifact@v3` 

Upload using Multiple Paths and Exclusions
with:
    name: my-artifact
    path: |
        dist
        package.json 

## Job Outputs
Besides Artifacts, Stesp can product and share simple values, these outputs are shared via `::set-output`
Jobs can pick up & share Step outputs via the `steps` context
Other Jobs can use Job outputs via the needs context
- Some Simple values
- Typically used for re-using a value in different jobs, example: Name of a file generated in a previous build step.
- `find dist/assets/*.js -type f -execdir echo '{}' ';'`
- `find dist/assets/*.js -type f -execdir echo '::set-output name=script-file::{}' ';'`


## Caching Dependencies

Caching can help speed up repeated, slow Steps
Typical use-case: Caching dependencies
But any files & folder can be cached
The cache Action automatically stores & updates cache values(based on the cache key)
Important: Don't use caching for artifacts!

- Get code -> Install Dependencies -> Test App
- Get code -> Install Dependencies -> Build Project
Often repeated & Dependencies don't change frequently

`actions/cache`
