# Getting Started with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform that enables developers to streamline their CI/CD processes and automate various tasks within their software development workflows. In this blog, we will take through the essential steps to get started with GitHub Actions. By the end of this guide, we'll have a clear understanding of how to set up our first repository for Actions, grasp the basic syntax and structure of workflows, and create a simple workflow.

## 1. Setting up the First GitHub Repository for Actions

To begin, we need a GitHub repository where we can implement GitHub Actions. If you already have a repository, you can skip this step. Otherwise, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Repository**: Log in to the GitHub account and click on the "+" icon in the top right corner. Choose "New repository."

2. **Repository Name and Settings**: Give the repository a name, description, and choose the appropriate settings. You can choose to make the repository public or private based on your preferences.

3. **Initializing with a README**: You can choose to initialize the repository with a README file. This is optional but can be helpful to provide an initial overview of your project.

4. **Create Repository**: Click the "Create repository" button to finalize the repository creation.

## 2. Basic Syntax and Structure of GitHub Actions Workflows

Now that we have the repository set up, it's time to dive into GitHub Actions workflows. Workflows are defined using YAML syntax and are stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of our repository.

Let's create a basic workflow that runs whenever code is pushed to the `master` branch.

1. **Create Workflow File**: In the repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory. (If it doesn't exist, create it.)

2. **Create YAML File**: Inside the `.github/workflows` directory, create a new file named `first-action.yml`.

3. **Define Workflow**: In the `first-action.yml` file, define our workflow using YAML syntax. Like this:

![01.%20Create%20.github-workflows%20folder.png](./assets/01.%20Create%20.github-workflows%20folder.png)

```yaml

name: First Workflow
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

```

In this example, we've named the workflow "CI Workflow" and specified that it should be triggered on `push` events to the `master` branch.

## 3. Creating Your First Simple Workflow

With the basic structure in place, let's add a job to our workflow that runs a simple action whenever a push event occurs.

1. **Add a Job**: Modify the `first-action.yml` file to include a job:


![Create first workflow file.png](./assets/01.%20Create%20first%20workflow%20file.png)

```yaml

name: First Workflow
on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  first-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: First Step
        run: echo "Hello World!"
      - name: Second Step
        run: echo "Tsch√ºss!"
```

In this example, we've added a job named `build` to our workflow. This job runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. Within the job, we have two steps: one to check out the repository using the `actions/checkout` action, and another to print a simple message.

2. **Commit and Push**: Commit the `first-action.yml` file to our repository and push the changes.

3. **Workflow Execution**: GitHub Actions will automatically detect the new workflow file and start executing it whenever we push code to the `master` branch. We can monitor the progress and view the workflow runs under the "Actions" tab in the repository.

## Conclusion

In this section, we've covered the initial steps to get started with GitHub Actions. We've learned how to set up our first repository, understand the basic syntax and structure of workflows, and create a simple workflow that executes actions on a code push event. This is just the beginning of what we can achieve with GitHub Actions.
