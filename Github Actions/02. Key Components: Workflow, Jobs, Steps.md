# Demystifying GitHub Actions: Key Components - Workflows, Jobs & Steps

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that automates various tasks in your software development workflow, enabling you to build, test, and deploy your code with ease. To harness its full potential, you need to understand its key components: Workflows, Jobs, and Steps. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into these components, exploring how they function, how they interact, and how they can supercharge your development process.

## Workflows

### Attached to a GitHub repository

Workflows are the backbone of GitHub Actions. They are workflows defined in code, typically living within your repository under the `.github/workflows` directory. These YAML files define the automation process you want to run in response to specific events, such as code pushes, pull requests, or issue creation.

Creating a workflow file is as simple as creating a new YAML file in the aforementioned directory and configuring it according to your needs. For instance, you can create a workflow that automatically builds and tests your application every time someone pushes code to the `main` branch.

Here's a basic example of a workflow file:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test
```

In this example, we have defined a workflow named "CI/CD Pipeline" that triggers on every push to the `main` branch. It consists of a single job named "build," which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. This job contains two steps: one for checking out the code and another for building and testing the project.

### Contain one or more Jobs

Workflows are not limited to just one job; they can contain multiple jobs. This capability is particularly valuable when you have complex automation processes with different requirements. For instance, you might want to build and test your code in parallel on different platforms or deploy it to different environments based on the branch pushed.

Here's an extended example:

```yaml
name: Multi-Job Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build-linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and test (Linux)
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test

  build-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and test (Windows)
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment steps go here
```

In this workflow, we have three jobs: `build-linux`, `build-windows`, and `deploy`. The `build-linux` and `build-windows` jobs run concurrently on different platforms, while the `deploy` job runs conditionally only if the push event is on the `main` branch.

### Triggered upon Events

Workflows are event-driven, meaning they are triggered by specific events. GitHub provides a wide range of events that can trigger workflows, including:

- **Push events:** When code is pushed to the repository.
- **Pull request events:** When a pull request is opened, updated, or merged.
- **Issue events:** When issues are opened, updated, or closed.
- **Scheduled events:** At specific times or intervals.
- **Manual events:** Manually triggered by a user.
- **Workflow events:** When other workflows are completed or specific workflow events occur.

You can configure your workflow to respond to one or more of these events. For example, you might want to run tests on every push, build and deploy on pull request merges to the `main` branch, and schedule nightly backups of your database.

## Jobs

### Define a Runner (execution environment)

Jobs are the units of work within a workflow. Each job defines a set of steps that run on a specific execution environment called a **runner**. A runner is essentially a virtual machine or container where your job's steps are executed.

GitHub provides runners with various operating systems, such as Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS, as well as different hardware specifications. You can choose the runner that best suits your job's requirements.

Here's an example of defining runners in your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  build-linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  build-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest

  build-macos:
    runs-on: macos-latest
```

In this example, we have three jobs, each specifying its runner. `build-linux` runs on an Ubuntu-based runner, `build-windows` on a Windows-based runner, and `build-macos` on a macOS-based runner.

### Contain one or more Steps

Jobs consist of one or more steps. Steps are individual tasks that your job performs, such as checking out code, building, testing, deploying, or even sending notifications. These steps are executed in order, one after the other, within the job's runner.

Here's an example of defining steps in a job:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build
        run: npm install

      - name: Test
        run: npm test
```

In this job, there are three steps: "Checkout code," "Build," and "Test." They execute in sequence, and the job proceeds to the next step only if the previous one succeeds.

### Run in parallel (default) or sequential

By default, jobs in a workflow run in parallel, which means they execute concurrently on different runners if available. This parallelism can significantly speed up your workflow, especially when you have multiple jobs that don't depend on each other.

However, there are cases where you want jobs to run sequentially, where one job must finish before the next one starts. You can achieve this by specifying dependencies between jobs.

Here's an example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set up environment for testing
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

In this workflow, the `test` job depends on the `build` job. The `test` job will only start if the `build` job completes successfully. This sequential execution ensures that testing is performed on the built code.

### Can be conditional

Jobs can also be conditional, meaning they only run when specific conditions are met. You can use the `if` keyword to define conditions based on various factors like branch names, pull request labels, or environment variables.

Here's an example:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment steps go here
```

In this job, the `if` condition checks if the workflow was triggered by a push event on the `main` branch. If this condition is met, the job runs; otherwise, it is skipped. Conditional jobs are handy when you want to run specific tasks only under certain circumstances.

## Steps

### Execute a shell script or an Action

Steps are where the real work happens in your jobs. Each step defines a specific action that is executed on the runner. These actions can be simple shell scripts or more complex actions provided by the GitHub community or your organization.

Here's an example of a step that runs a shell script:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build
    run: npm install
```

In this step, the name "Build" is given to describe its purpose, and the `run` field specifies the shell script to execute, which installs project dependencies using `npm`.

Steps can also use custom or third-party Actions, which are reusable, shareable units of automation. Actions can be used to encapsulate complex logic and make your workflows more modular and maintainable.

Here's an example of a step that uses a third-party action to deploy to AWS:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy to AWS
    uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
    with:
      aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
      aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      aws-region: us-east-1

  - name: Deploy
    uses: aws-actions/aws-code-deploy@v1
    with:
      application-name: my-app
      deployment-group: production
      region: us-east-1
```

In this example, the first step uses the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action to set up AWS credentials securely using GitHub secrets. The second step then uses the `aws-actions/aws-code-deploy` action to deploy the application to AWS.

### Can use custom or third-party Actions

GitHub Actions provides a vast marketplace of pre-built actions that you can use in your workflows. These actions cover a wide range of use cases, from deploying to cloud providers, sending notifications, publishing packages, and more. You can also create your custom actions to encapsulate your specific automation logic.

By leveraging these actions, you can significantly simplify your workflow configuration, as you can reuse them across different workflows and repositories. This modularity promotes best practices and collaboration among developers.

### Steps are executed in order

Steps within a job execute sequentially, one after the other, in the order they are defined. This ordering ensures that each step has access to the results and artifacts produced by the previous ones. For example, in a build job, you'd want to run the tests only after the code is built.

You can also configure steps to depend on the success of previous steps. If a step fails, subsequent steps in the same job won't run, preventing unnecessary work and speeding up feedback in your workflows.

### Can be conditional

Just like jobs, steps can also be conditional. You can use the `if` keyword to control whether a step runs based on specific conditions. For example, you might want to run a deployment step only if the build and tests are successful.

Here's an example:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build
    run: npm install

  - name: Test
    run: npm test

  - name: Deploy
    run: |
      # Deployment steps go here
    if: success()
```

In this workflow, the "Deploy" step only runs if both the "Build" and "Test" steps succeed. The `if: success()` condition ensures that the deployment is contingent on the success of the preceding steps.

## A Simple Demo:

```yaml
name: Build
# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  first-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: First Step
        run: echo "Hello World!"
      - name: Second Step
        run: echo "Tschüss!"
  second-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: First Step in second job
        run: echo "Hello again!"
      - name: Second Step in second job
        run: echo "Auf Wiedersehen!"
  third-job:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    # will run after "second-job"
    needs: [second-job]
    steps:
      - name: First Step in third job
        run: echo "LOL hello!"
      - name: Second Step in third job
        run: echo "Ciao!"
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the key components of GitHub Actions—Workflows, Jobs, and Steps—is crucial for harnessing its automation capabilities effectively. Workflows define the overall automation process, while Jobs and Steps break down the work into manageable units.

Jobs define the execution environment and can run sequentially or in parallel, depending on your needs. They can also be conditional, running only when specific conditions are met. Steps, on the other hand, execute the actual work, whether it's running scripts or using custom or third-party Actions. Steps are executed in order and can also be conditional.

By mastering these components, you can create sophisticated automation pipelines that streamline your development process, improve code quality, and enhance collaboration among your team members. GitHub Actions empowers you to automate repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on what matters most—building and delivering great software.
