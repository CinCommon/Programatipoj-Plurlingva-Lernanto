# Custom Actions

## Why Custom Actions?
- Simplify Workflow Steps
  Instead of writing multiple(possibly very complex) Step definitions, you can build and use a single custon Action
  Multiple Steps can be grouped into a single custom Action
- No Existing(Community) Action
  Existing, public Actions might not solve the specific problem you have in your workflow.
  Custom Actions can contain any logic you need to solve your specific Workflow problems.

## Different Types of Custom Actions
- JavaScript Actions
  Execute a JavaScript file
  Use JavaScript(Node.js) + any packages of your choice
  Pretty straightforward(if you know JavaScript)
- Docker Actions
  Create a Dockerfile with your required configuration
  Perform any task(s) of your choice with any language
  Lots of flexibility but requires Docker knowledge
- Composite Actions
  Combine multiple Workflow Steps in one single Action
  Combine run(commands) and uses(Actions)
  Allows for reusing shared Steps(without extra skills)

### First Custom actions
```yaml
name: 'Get & Cache Dependencies'
description: 'Get the dependencies (via npm) and cache them'
runs:
  # must be using in `composite` option, to tell github actions it's a composite action
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    # Set up Node.js environment
    - name: Setup Node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 14
    - name: Setup Cache Path
      id: cache_path
      run: |
        echo 'CACHE_PATH=deps-node-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}' >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      shell: bash
    # Cache dependencies to speed up workflow
    - name: Cache dependencies
      id: cache_action
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: |
          ~/.npm
          ./node_modules
        key: ${{ steps.cache_path.outputs.CACHE_PATH }}

    # Install project dependencies
    - name: Install Dependencies
      if: steps.cache_action.outputs.cache-hit != 'true
      run: |
        npm install
      shell: bash
```

```yaml
name: Show how to use Artifacts.

# Specify when the workflow should be triggered
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  workflow_dispatch:

# Define the jobs in the workflow
jobs:
  # Job for testing and linting
  test-and-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      CACHE_PATH_OUTPUT: ${{ steps.cache_path.outputs.CACHE_PATH }}
    steps:
      # Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Load & cache dependencies
        uses: ./github/actions/cached-deps
      # Lint and run unit tests
      - name: Lint And Test
        run: |
          npm run lint
          npm run test:unit

```
