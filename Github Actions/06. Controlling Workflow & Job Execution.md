# Controlling Workflow & Job Execution

## Conditional Jobs & Steps

Jobs: Conditional execution via `if` field

Steps:
    - Conditional execution via `if` field
    - Ignore errors via `continue-on-error` field

Evaluate conditions via Expressions

```yaml
    - name: Run Tests
      id: run-tests
      run: npm run test:unit
    - name: Upload test report
      if: steps.run-tests.outcome == 'failure'
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: test-report
        path: test.json
```

`failure()`: Returns true when any previous Step or Job failed
`success()`: Returns true when none of the previous steps have failed
`always()`: Causes the Step to always execute even when cancelled
`cancelled()`: Returns true if the workflow has been cancelled 


```yaml
    - name: Run Tests
      id: run-tests
      run: npm run test:unit
    - name: Upload test report
      if: failure() && steps.run-tests.outcome == 'failure'
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: test-report
        path: test.json
```
