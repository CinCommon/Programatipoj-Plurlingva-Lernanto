## what is centralized account

A centralized account is an AWS account that is designated to manage and govern other AWS accounts in an organization. It serves as a hub that can manage and monitor the usage, security, and compliance of multiple AWS accounts in a consistent and efficient way. By using a centralized account, organizations can simplify the management of their AWS resources and ensure that they are being used in a secure and compliant manner. For example, a centralized account can be used to create and manage IAM roles, set up billing and cost allocation, and configure security policies across multiple AWS accounts.
