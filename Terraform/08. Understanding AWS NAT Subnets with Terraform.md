# Understanding AWS NAT Subnets with Terraform

NAT (Network Address Translation) subnets provide a way for resources in private subnets to access the Internet in a controlled and secured manner.

In this post, we will dive deep into NAT subnets and see how to configure them on AWS using Terraform.

## Overview of NAT Subnets

A NAT subnet resides in a public subnet and hosts a NAT Gateway. The NAT Gateway has a public IP address and performs source/destination NAT for instances in the private subnets that route their Internet traffic to the NAT Gateway.

This allows instances in the private subnets to access the Internet for downloads, updates etc. At the same time, the instances remain hidden behind the NAT Gateway with no public IP.

NAT Subnets provide the following benefits:

- Resources in private subnets can securely access the Internet.
- Resources in private subnets remain isolated and hidden from the Internet.
- You have granular control over Internet access from private subnets via NAT rules.

## NAT Subnet Architecture

A typical NAT subnet architecture looks like:

- **Public Subnets** - Contains resources like load balancers that need to be Internet facing.
- **Private Subnets** - Contains backend resources like EC2 instances and RDS databases that should be shielded from the Internet.
- **NAT Subnet** - The NAT subnet resides in the public subnet zone and contains the NAT Gateway.

The private subnet resources route Internet traffic to the NAT Gateway which then maps the resources' private IPs to its own public IP.

Now let's see how to configure this architecture using Terraform.

## Terraform NAT Subnet Example

```hcl
# Create VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "my-vpc"
  }
}

# Create Internet Gateway 
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "igw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  tags = {
    Name = "main-igw"
  }
}

# Create Public Subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnet" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"

  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet"  
  }
}

# Create Private Subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "private_subnet" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"

  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet"
  }
}  

# Create NAT Subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "nat_subnet" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.3.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"

  tags = {
    Name = "nat-subnet" 
  }
}

# Create NAT Gateway
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "nat_gw" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat_eip.id
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.nat_subnet.id

  tags = {
    Name = "nat-gw"
  }
}

# Create Elastic IP for NAT Gateway
resource "aws_eip" "nat_eip" {
  vpc = true

  tags = {
    Name = "nat-eip"
  }
}

# Create Public Route Table
resource "aws_route_table" "public_rt" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.igw.id
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "public-rt"
  }
}

# Create Private Route Table  
resource "aws_route_table" "private_rt" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.nat_gw.id
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "private-rt"
  }
}

# Associate Public RT with Public Subnet
resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_subnet_rta" {
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public_rt.id
}

# Associate Private RT with Private Subnet
resource "aws_route_table_association" "private_subnet_rta" {
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.private_subnet.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.private_rt.id  
}
```

Key points:

- Create a dedicated NAT subnet in the public zone along with a NAT Gateway.
- Allocate an Elastic IP and attach it to the NAT Gateway.
- Create separate route tables for public and private subnets.
- Public RT routes Internet traffic via the Internet Gateway.
- Private RT routes Internet traffic via the NAT Gateway.

This provides a configurable NAT subnet setup to manage Internet access for resources in the private subnets.

## Conclusion

NAT subnets allow resources in private subnets to securely access the Internet via a NAT Gateway. The NAT Gateway hides the private IP of the resources behind its public IP.

We saw how to create such an architecture on AWS using Terraform - carving the VPC into public, private and NAT subnets with appropriate routing rules.

NAT subnets provide granular control and security for Internet access from private resources on the cloud.
