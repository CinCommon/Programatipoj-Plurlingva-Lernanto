# Output attributes

Output attributes in Terraform allow you to print certain values from resources in your infrastructure after apply. They are defined using the `output` block:

```terraform
output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.example.id
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip 
}
```

Here, we are defining two output attributes - instance_id and instance_public_ip.

The value field specifies an attribute from a resource to return. Here we are getting the id and public_ip attributes of the aws_instance resource.

To use outputs:

1. Define output blocks with a name and value source
2. Run `terraform apply` - this will show the outputs at the end
3. Access outputs anytime after apply using `terraform output <NAME>`

For example:

```terraform
$ terraform output instance_id
i-098765432123456
```

Outputs are useful for referencing key values from your resources after apply, like IDs, IPs, DNS names etc. You can script/access these values for workflows after infrastructure creation.

You can also output complex expressions, not just single attributes:

```terraform
output "instance_ssh_command" {
  value = "ssh -i mykey.pem ubuntu@${aws_instance.example.public_ip}" 
}
```

So in summary, output attributes let you conveniently access resource values after apply. They are defined using `output` blocks and accessed via `terraform output`.

## Scenarios

**Get resource IDs** - Output the id attribute of resources like aws_instance, aws_db_instance etc. This allows referencing the resources outside Terraform.

```terraform
output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.app.id
}

output "db_instance_id" {
  value = aws_db_instance.postgres.id
}
```

**Show DNS names/URLs** - For resources like aws_lb, aws_instance, you can output the dns_name or public_dns attributes to print load balancer URLs, instance names etc.

```terraform
output "lb_dns_name" {
  value = aws_lb.frontend.dns_name
}

output "app_url" {
  value = "http://${aws_instance.web.public_dns}/login"
}
```

**Print connection strings** - For resources like database instances, you can output the connection string or endpoint URL for apps to consume.

```terraform
output "db_connection_string" {
  value = "postgresql://${aws_db_instance.postgres.username}:${aws_db_instance.postgres.password}@${aws_db_instance.postgres.endpoint}/mydb"
}
```

**API access URLs** - Output the endpoint URLs for resources like aws_api_gateway_deployment to allow accessing the deployed API.

```terraform
output "api_url" {
  value = aws_api_gateway_deployment.example.invoke_url
}
```

**SSH commands** - As shown earlier, you can output SSH commands for EC2 instances by combining attributes like public_ip, ssh_key etc.

```terraform
output "ssh_command" {
  value = "ssh -i mykey ubuntu@${aws_instance.app.public_ip}" 
}
```

**Instructions after apply** - You can output instructions for next steps after infrastructure creation like "App URL: [http://abc.xyz](http://abc.xyz/)".

```terraform
output "instructions" {
  value = "App deployed to ${aws_instance.app.public_dns}. Configure DNS to point example.com to this URL." 
}
```

**Pass values to other steps** - Output values to be consumed in later scripts/workflows like instance ids, dns names etc.

```terraform
# terraform.tf
output "db_password" {
  value = aws_db_instance.mysql.password
}

# deploy.sh
MYSQL_PASSWORD=$(terraform output db_password)

echo "Setting MySQL password to $MYSQL_PASSWORD"
```

**Configuration files** - Generate and output config files/connection details for applications to use.

```terraform
resource "local_file" "config" {
  filename = "/app/config.yml"

  content = <<EOT
database:
  host: ${aws_db_instance.mysql.address}
  password: ${aws_db_instance.mysql.password}
EOT
}

output "config_file" {
  value = local_file.config.filename
}
```

Some other ideas:

- **Troubleshooting** - Outputting resource attributes can help debug issues by quickly checking values.

- Output API keys for usage in app code
- Generate Kubernetes pod spec files with resource values inserted
- Pass S3 bucket names to a CI/CD pipeline
- Output connection strings to a Docker env file

The key is outputting values needed by some external process - scripts, apps, CICD systems etc. This avoids hardcoding things like credentials or resource names in different places.
