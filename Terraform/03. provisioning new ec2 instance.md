A: Why use `vpc_security_group_ids` not `security_groups`

Q: Great question!

The aws_instance resource in Terraform accepts two similar but different arguments for security groups:

- `security_groups` - Accepts a list of security group names
- `vpc_security_group_ids` - Accepts a list of security group IDs

The key difference is that `vpc_security_group_ids` requires you to reference the ID attribute of the `aws_security_group` resources, rather than just the name.

There are a few advantages to using `vpc_security_group_ids:`

- Avoid conflicts with existing security groups - Referencing IDs instead of names avoids collisions/conflicts if there are existing security groups with the same name.
- Dependency management - Using the ID creates an implicit dependency between the aws_instance and the referenced aws_security_group. This makes sure the security group is created first.
- Move between VPCs - You can reuse the same security group in different VPCs by id without confusion.
- Avoid errors if name changes - The id remains constant even if the name changes, avoiding errors.

So in summary, vpc_security_group_ids is considered best practice because it uses the immutable ID rather than name, avoiding conflicts and handling dependencies automatically.

The one caveat is that it requires you to define the security groups as resources, rather than just passing a name string. But this is usually better for manageability anyway.
