# AWS networking essentials.

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides a private virtual network for your AWS resources. With VPC, you can have complete control over your virtual networking environment. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore key components of AWS VPC networking.

## VPC Fundamentals

A VPC represents a virtual private cloud inside the AWS cloud. When you create a VPC, you define a VPC region and CIDR block (IP address range). All resources launched inside your VPC will have IP addresses in this range.

Your VPC spans all Availability Zones in the region to provide high availability to applications. You can provision AWS resources like EC2 instances, RDS databases, etc within your VPC.

### Default and Dedicated VPCs

Your AWS account comes with a default VPC in each region. You can also create custom dedicated VPCs based on your requirements.

The default VPC comes with subnets, route tables, NACLs, security groups, etc preconfigured. With dedicated VPCs, you create these resources from scratch.

### VPC Peering

You can peer two VPCs to enable network connectivity between them. VPC peering connections are virtual network links that avoid using internet gateways. Resources in peered VPCs can communicate with each other across the VPC peering connection.

### VPC Endpoints

VPC endpoints allow private connectivity between your VPC and supported AWS services like S3 without routing through the internet. This enhances security and performance.

## Subnets and Network Segmentation

A subnet is a section of the VPC IP address range that you designate for an Availability Zone. You can segment your VPC into multiple subnets for isolation and security.

### Public Subnets

Public subnets host resources like web servers that need to be accessible from the internet. Public subnets have a route table entry directing internet traffic to an internet gateway.

### Private Subnets

Private subnets host backend servers and databases that should remain isolated from the internet. Private subnets do not have a route directing traffic to the internet gateway.

### NAT Subnets

You can optionally create NAT subnets which host NAT gateways used by resources in private subnets to access the internet in a controlled manner. NAT subnets have routes for internet traffic.

## Internet Gateways

An internet gateway enables bidirectional communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It performs NAT for instances with public IPv4 addresses.

You attach an internet gateway to your VPC, which directs internet traffic from your subnets via the gateway. An internet gateway scales horizontally to handle bandwidth needs.

## NAT Gateways and NAT Instances

Resources in private subnets can securely access the internet by using NAT devices like NAT gateways or NAT instances.

NAT gateways provide automatic scaling, redundancy and bandwidth capabilities that are superior to NAT instances.

NAT devices translate the private IP of your instance to a public IP. Responses from the internet are translated back to the instance's private IP.

### High Availability with NAT Gateways

You can create multiple NAT gateways in each Availability Zone and configure your route tables for high availability. The gateways scale up to 10 Gbps bandwidth per gateway.

## Elastic IP Addresses

Elastic IP addresses are public IPv4 addresses that you can allocate to your account. You can associate them with instances or NAT gateways to provide static, persistent IP addresses.

Elastic IPs allow masking instance or NAT gateway failures by rapidly remapping your IP to a new instance.

## Route Tables

Your VPC has an implicit router and main route table that you can modify. You can create custom route tables to have greater control over network traffic leaving your subnets.

For example, you can create a route for internet traffic to flow through an internet gateway or NAT device.

### Route Table Association

You need to associate subnets with appropriate route tables to define their traffic flow. A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time.

Proper route table and subnet association enables designing public, private, NAT and isolated subnets.

## Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Network ACLs act as firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. You can configure ACL rules to filter traffic between subnets.

ACLs have separate inbound and outbound rules. Each rule can allow or deny traffic based on IP protocol, port and source/destination IP.

## VPC Flow Logs

VPC Flow Logs enable capturing network traffic information for monitoring and troubleshooting connectivity issues. The flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3.

In summary, VPC provides an isolated virtual cloud network to deploy your resources. Components like subnets, route tables, NAT gateways and internet gateways help architect your network architecture spanning public, private, NAT and isolated tiers.
