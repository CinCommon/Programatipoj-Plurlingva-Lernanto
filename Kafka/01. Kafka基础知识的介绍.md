# Kafka基础知识

## Decoupling of data streams & systems

## Why Apache Kafka
1. Open Source Project mainly maintained by Confluent
2. Distributed, resilient architecture, fault tolerant
3. Horizontal Scalability:
   1. Can scale to 100s of brokers
   2. Can scale to millions of messages per second
4. High performance (latency of less than 10ms) - real time
5. Used by the 2000+ firms, 35 of the Fortune 500.

## Use cases
- Messaging System
- Activity Tracking
- Gather metrics from many different locations
- Application Logs gathering
- Stream processing(with the Kafka Streams API or Spark for example)
- De-coupling of system dependecies
- Integration with Spark, Flink, Storm, Hadoop, and many other Big Data technologies.

**Kafka is only used as a transportation mechanism**

## Topics, partitions and offsets
- Topics: a particular stream of data
    - Similar to a table in a database(without all the constraints)
    - You can have as many topics as you want
    - A topic is identified by its name
- Topics are split in **partitions**
  - Each partition is ordered
  - Each message within a partition gets an incremental id, call **offset**
    

## 点对点消息系统

## 发布订阅消息系统
> 将消息持久化到Topic中，消费者可以订阅一个或多个topic，同一个消息可以被多个消费者消费
