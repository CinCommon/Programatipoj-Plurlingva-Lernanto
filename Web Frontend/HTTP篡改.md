# HTTP篡改
## HTTP
### 原理
> HTTP does not encrypt data during client-to-server communication, which means that any data transmitted over HTTP is sent in plain text without any encryption or security mechanisms. As a result, it can be intercepted and read by anyone with access to the network traffic, including cybercriminals.
> Additionally, HTTP does not provide any authentication, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers can eavesdrop on communication between a server and a client, resulting in the theft of personal information such as login credentials and credit card numbers.
